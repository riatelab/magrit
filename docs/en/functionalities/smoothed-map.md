# Smoothed map

This is a method for analyzing and representing the spatial distribution of a phenomenon,
whatever the heterogeneity of the mesh, at any point on the map, via the representation of the phenomenon's density
value and the consideration of its neighborhood.

Depending on the parameters used, these methods make it possible *"to see both the local specificities of a phenomenon and its general trends"* (Lambert & Zanin, 2016).

The two proposed smoothing methods are:

- Stewart potential,
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
