# Mushrooms / Representation of two stocks

This representation method shows two stocks (or two values) on a map using proportional semi-circles.

This method makes it possible to compare two values for each geographical entity.

This method was popularized by [Emile Cheysson](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~309243~90079146:Resultats-D-Exploitation-des-Chemin?sort=pub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_date%2Cpub_list_no%2Cseries_no&qvq=q:Cheysson%2C%20%C3%89mile;sort:pub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_date%2Cpub_list_no%2Cseries_no;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&mi=183&trs=587) in 1886.

## Parameters

The representation parameters are the same as for proportional symbols, except that it is necessary to choose parameters for two values instead of one.
