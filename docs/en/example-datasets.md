## Cartographic templates

## Europe

The cartographic template contains two main layers, NUTS 2 and NUTS 3, as well as a number of layout layers (neighboring countries, capitals, boxes, etc.).

In this template, the outermost territories of the European Union are brought closer to continental Europe and arranged in boxes for better visualization.
