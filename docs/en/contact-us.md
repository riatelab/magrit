# Contact us

## Reporting a bug

The best way to contact the Magrit team is via the GitHub platform, on the code
repository ([riatelab/magrit](https://github.com/riatelab/magrit)), for example by creating a
[issue](https://github.com/riatelab/magrit/issues).

This is the preferred way, as the bug reports created in this way are public and allow all users to follow the exchanges and see if the problem has already been reported.

## Other questions
