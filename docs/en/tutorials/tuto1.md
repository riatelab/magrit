# Tutorial - Getting started with Magrit
# Example 2: Using a sample dataset

We will create a simple thematic map with Magrit using the sample datasets provided.

This will allow us to discover the basic features of the application (display of the data table, choice of a representation, map styling, and map export)
without worrying about data retrieval or preparation.

## Step 1: Open the application

There are several ways to access the Magrit application:
- By using the direct link: [https://magrit.cnrs.fr/app/](https://magrit.cnrs.fr/app/) (also accessible from the "Access the application" button at the top of each page of the documentation),
- By downloading the application executable corresponding to your platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) from the application download page: [https://magrit.cnrs.fr/download/](https://magrit.cnrs.fr/download/).

We choose the first option to access the application and therefore go to the URL [https://magrit.cnrs.fr/app/](https://magrit.cnrs.fr/app/).
