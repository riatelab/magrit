# Roadmap

This document describes the roadmap for the project after the publication of v2 (July 2024).


## Summer-Autumn 2025

- Explore the support of raster datasets (this implies deciding how to render these datasets "by default" but also proposing representation and analysis functionalities dedicated to this new type of data).
- Explore support for tiled raster background maps (such as OpenStreetMap tiles).
- Enable map rendering on an HTML Canvas element to improve overall application performance when large datasets are added.
- Explore the possibility of preparing several maps (for comparison, for example) simultaneously in the interface.
- Explore the possibility of adding geocoding functionality to tabular datasets.
- Add new cartographic methods (bivariate choropleth and choropleth based on ternary composition).
- Add new statistical methods for thematic cartography (notably PCA + hierarchical clustering).
