# Roadmap

This document describes the roadmap for the project after the publication of v2 (July 2024).

## Winter 2024-2025

- Enable map rendering on an HTML Canvas element to improve overall application performance when large datasets are added.
- Explore the possibility of preparing several maps (for comparison, for example) simultaneously in the interface.
- Explore the possibility of adding geocoding functionality to tabular datasets.
- Add new statistical methods for thematic cartography (notably PCA + hierarchical clustering).

## Spring 2025

- Explore the support of raster datasets (this implies deciding how to render these datasets "by default" but also proposing representation and analysis functionalities dedicated to this new type of data).
- Explore support for tiled raster background maps (such as OpenStreetMap tiles).
