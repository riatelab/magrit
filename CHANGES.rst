------------------

- Prevent some error when opening layer with non unique entries in field named 'id' (internally caused by the fact we use geojson and fiona is failing on opening geojson with duplicates in that field).

------------------

- New: allow to analyze a layer of points by two means : through a regular grid or through an existing layer of polygons. Informations computed are either the density of items (weighted or not) in each cell/polygon or a statistical summary (mean or standard deviation) about the items belonging to each cell/polygon.


0.6.7 (2018-02-01)
------------------

- Fix links creation on some cases when using integers as identifiers.

0.6.5 (2018-01-12)
------------------

- Be more tolerant with in the regular expression used to filter the name of exported maps (by allowing dot, dash and parentheses for example).

- Fix the displaying of the "waiting" overlay when loading a TopoJSON layer.

- Fix the displaying of the "horizontal layout" option for legend when used on a categorical choropleth map + rounding precision for "horizontal layout" legend and "proportional symbols" legend.

------------------

- Slightly change how field type is determined.

- Try to improve the 'active'/'pushed' effect on buttons located on the bottom-right of the map.

- Try to be lighter on the use of memory (by reducing the TTL of redis entries and by not saving (for later reuse) intermediate results anymore when computing potentials).

0.6.3 (2017-12-14)
------------------

0.6.2 (2017-12-12)

- Disable the ability to use sphere and graticule with lambert conic conformal projection (the generated path, which is currently not clipped when using Proj4 projections, could be very heavy due to the conical nature of the projection).

- Allow to cancel the ongoing addition of a layout item by pressing Esc (and so inform the user about that in the notification).

- Improve the legend for proportional symbols (only for "single color" ones) by also using the stroke color of the result layer in the legend.
